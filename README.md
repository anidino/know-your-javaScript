For this assignment, our class used our knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation to create a quiz that tests the user's knowledge of JavaScript! 

There are five questions and the timer is set to 15 seconds. The user selects an answer simply by clicking on their answer choice. Once the user clicks an answer, a new question appears. When time is up, a window alert appears and says "Time is up but keep trying!" When the user completes the quiz, they are told their score and have the option to try again.
